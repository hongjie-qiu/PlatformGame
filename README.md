# PlatformGame
A Mario-like tile-based 2D platform game that uses floating point truncation to implement 
robust collision between a moving tile and a tilemap representing the level.

### Description
Users can control the movement of the character using left and right arrows, or pressing  
the space bar to make the character jump.  
The goal is to collect all the coins in the map.
